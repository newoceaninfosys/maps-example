# Guide to integrate react-native-maps

## Step 01: Create new project (ignore if you have one existing)
```
react-native init MyMap
cd MyMap
yarn add react-native-maps
```

## Step 02: Setup iOS project (Make sure you have [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed on your Mac)

```
cd ios
pod init
```

Open `Podfile` in your vscode (atom, phpstorm etc...)

```
# Podfile content
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'MyMap' do
    pod 'React',
      :path => "../node_modules/react-native",
      :subspecs => [
        "Core",
        "ART",
        "RCTActionSheet",
        "RCTAnimation",
        "RCTCameraRoll",
        "RCTGeolocation",
        "RCTImage",
        "RCTNetwork",
        "RCTText",
        "RCTVibration",
        "RCTWebSocket",
        "DevSupport",
        "BatchedBridge"
      ]
  pod 'Yoga', :path => "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga"
  pod 'GoogleMaps'
  pod 'react-native-maps', path: '../node_modules/react-native-maps/'
  pod 'react-native-google-maps', path: '../node_modules/react-native-maps/'
  
end
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name == "react-native-google-maps"
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                config.build_settings['CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES'] = 'No'
            end
        end
    end
end
```

## Step 03: install Podfile

```
// If your pod repo too old, do update before install: pod repo update
pod install
```

## Step 04: Open project

```
open MyMap.xcworkspace
open .
```

- Drag this folder `node_modules/react-native-maps/lib/ios/AirGoogleMaps/` into your project, and choose `Create groups` in the popup window.
- In your project's `Build Settings` > `Header Search Paths`, double click the value field. In the popup, add `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-maps/lib/ios/AirMaps` and change `non-recursive` to `recursive`

## Step 05: Enable Google Map SDK for iOS and Google Map Android API (Very important)

Go to [Google console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library), choose or create new project, go to library then enable 2 libraries:
- Google Map SDK for iOS
- Google Map Android API

Then create new `Credentials` key

## Step 06: Edit AppDelegate.m

```
...
#import "AppDelegate.h"

#import <React/RCTBundleURLProvider.h>
#import <React/RCTRootView.h>
@import GoogleMaps; # INSERT THIS LINE

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  NSURL *jsCodeLocation;
  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR_KEY"]; # INSERT THIS LINE

  jsCodeLocation = [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index.ios" fallbackResource:nil];
...
```

## Step 07:
When run build with Xcode it will failed duplicate library, delete `-l"react-native-maps"` from both of your `Pods-Example.debug | release.xcconfig` at `OTHER_LDFLAGS`

You're done setting up iOS project, you can now `react-native run-ios`

## Step 08: Paste these line to `android/app/build.gradle`

```
dependencies {
    ...
    // Paste these line
    compile(project(':react-native-maps')){
        exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-base'
        exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-maps'
    }
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:11.+'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:11.+'
}
```

## Step 09: Insert key to `android/app/src/AndroidManifest.xml` (Very important)

```
<application>
    <!-- You will only need to add this meta-data tag, but make sure it's a child of application -->
    <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
      android:value="YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE"/>
</application>
```
